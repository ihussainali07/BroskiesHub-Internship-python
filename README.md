It is basically my first task assigned by BroskiesHub Python Programming Internship 2025.
In this task, we are required to design a Python-based calculator CLI App to perform simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers entered by the user. The program uses a loop that continues running until the user chooses to exit.
This repository (BroskiesHub-python-Task-01) contains:
One Python (.py) file
Two screenshots (01, 02) demonstrating the command-line interface
One README file
